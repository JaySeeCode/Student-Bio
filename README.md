Comment made on June 21, 2017:

This was the very first "project" or assignment we had during the program. With very limited knowledge and some assistance from the instructor, we built a small profile of ourselves using just HTML and CSS. The following week we were instructed to recreate it using Bootstrap. Since at the time I had had, at most, a few days of experience with Bootstrap, that one didn't end up looking as neat as the one we built under the instructor's guidance (since we were all new, he took the time to make an hour long video of himself walking us through how he would do the homework). 

I am not the most proud of this project, but it was my very first one, and so it hold a special sort of significance.
